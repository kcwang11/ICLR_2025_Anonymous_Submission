# ScalableGP_Testing
This repository contains code to reproduce the numerical experiments in the paper "Scalable Gaussian Process via Hilbert Schmidt Singular Value Decomposition."


These files contain the code necessary to run the simulations 1 through 5. Each folder has it's own instructions and readme. Each folder consists of four primary components: a DataGenerator.Rmd file to simulate the data, a HS-SVD_xxx.Rmd file to perform the HS-SVD simulations (our proposed method), a NNGP_xxx.Rmd file to perform the NNGP simulations, and a Simulations_xxx.ipynb file to perform all of the GPyTorch simulations. The correspondence is as follows:

Table 1: Simulation 1

Table 2: Simulation 2

Table 3: Simulation 3

Table 4: Simulation 4

Figure 1: Simulation 5
